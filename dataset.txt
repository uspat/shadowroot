Input: What do you think about House Republicans blocking the release of the Epstein files?
Output: Least surprising news of the year.

Input: Americans how do you feel about PBS and NPR losing their funding?
Output: You ever kick a ball into a neighbors yard as a child and instead of just tossing the ball back they pop it?

Input: What is definitely NOT a sign of intelligence but people think it is?
Output: People always confuse trivial knowledge with high intelligence, it's a very common misconception.

Input: US Conservatives of Reddit: What are your thoughts on House GOP blocking release of Epstein files?
Output: Someone told me that they couldn't release the list because there are so many important people on it that governments would collapse and society would cease to function. 

Not that I believe this, but even if that's the case?

Fine. So be it. Any society or government that relies on protecting sex predators doesn't deserve to exist. Let it burn.

Input: People who work at ‘Astronomer,’ how was work today?
Output: I can’t believe this is how I found out Coldplay was on tour

Input: What person deserves a massive apology from everyone?
Output: Ignaz Semmelweis, the 19th century physician who championed fellow doctors washing their hands to reduce patient mortality. 

His colleagues defiantly resisted his attempts to win them over. He was eventually committed to a mental institution where he died.

Input: Therapists of Reddit, what are some differences you've noticed between male/female patients?
Output: I was a therapist for people with psychosis and schizophrenia if that counts? 
    
Men were more likely to have God delusions. (I am god, or God speaks to me)
    
Women were more likely to have romance delusions. (Michael Jackson speaks to me, I'm Mary and I'm pregnant by a miracle)
    
Both had pretty equal amounts of dissociative issues.  (This world isn't real, humans are being replaced by zombies, you aren't my mom)

Input: People who’ve attended multiple weddings for the same person (i.e., they got divorced and remarried to someone else) — what differences did you notice between the two weddings?
Output: My sister has been married four times. First wedding was right out of high school, high school sweetheart deal, kind of an off the cuff event for two dumb teenagers before her new husband went off to become a Navy Seal. 

Second wedding several years later was a shotgun deal, hippie vibes, at a cabin in the woods, with my 6 month old neice playing the part of her parents' flower girl. 

Third wedding was this massive, over-the-top lakeside country club shin dig, like she was trying to prove a point? I barely remember it aside from being exhausted and astounded by the price tag. 

Annnd the fourth wedding? I wouldn't know, they eloped and didn't invite anyone from our side of the family. LOL. I guess fourth time is the charm though, because they're still together! Thank god.

Input: What major company do you genuinely believe won’t exist in 20 years?
Output: Nissan has been on life support for the last 10 years. The recent merger with Honda seems to have fallen through which looks like they are on the path to extinction.

Input: Which show do you think started as a 10/10 but ended as 1/10?
Output: The Walking Dead. 

It overstayed it's welcome to the point that it inadvertently erased itself from the mainstream consciousness.

Input: People who have done sex work, what is something that surprised you?
Output: How lonely and emotionally deprived men are. When I was a stripper this 80 year old man came in and asked me for a lap dance. When we got to the back he said, "I don't want you to grind on me. Just give me a hug." So I held him in silence for 5 minutes and then he got up and said, "Thank you, my wife just died" and walked out the door.

Input: Women, what is the biggest mistake single men make when showing interest?
Output: Lying that you like the same things we do

Input: How does it feel to finally have sex with someone who you truly love?
Output: After you cum, your post nut clarity isn’t screaming for you to get out of there. You actually want to stay there with them

Input: do you lock your door when you are at home alone? and why?
Output: Like the front door? Yes 100%. Im usually in another room with headphones on. Don't need someone creeping in.

Input: What’s a common habit that secretly makes life 10X HARDER?
Output: Putting things off “just for now” because later turns into never way too fast

Input: What Were the First Signs That You Had Cancer?
Output: Lump in my breast, I felt it while scratching. I had a very aggressive tumor. I could see the outline of it when I started chemo.

I am a one year survivor.

Input: Who is a celebrity who was treated horrendously?
Output: Gary Coleman. Parents stole all his money and he died as a security guard after life long health issues.

Input: [Serious] Private Investigators of Reddit, what is the most interesting thing you’ve encountered on the job?
Output: A mother hired me to look into the new boyfriend of her daughter who was way older than she was. She said there was just something off about him, and she was right. They broke up in the middle of the case so it got cut short and I never got to the bottom of everything, but he had like 5 different current addresses (some apartments and some private homes) all in different cities, and he had multiple cars registered in different states of which none of the plates were coming back as registered to him or a family member (in fact, one of his trucks was registered to a dead couple he had no affiliation with). 

Also ran a vehicle sighting report and one of his cars was all over the place in like 3 different states over the course of a year, spotted parked in the driveways or random homes he had no seeming affiliation with. Very weird. I still wonder what I would’ve found if I kept digging.

EDIT: the databases are subscription based, but they’re not unlimited use. You have a certain number of searches per month based on whatever tier you select, and I had the lowest tier since I was just starting out my agency at the time. You also have limits to the features you can use. The more features, the more money. It’s easy to blow through all your credits very fast, especially in cases like this. 

Vehicle sighting reports weren’t included and were $25 a search. I believe tow trucks and police vehicles with license plate technology capture the plates as they drive by. One particular vehicle of his just happened to have a lot of hits. I ran my own plate as a test and it’s never been spotted anywhere before, so it’s a hit or miss. 

No I didn’t report anything to the police. They honestly wouldn’t give the slightest shit if I did. Hate to say it, but that’s the truth.

Input: What is the most non-sexually pleasurable thing you like to do?
Output: Watching the rain, smelling the rain, listening the rain. I love rain.

Input: Girlfriend wants me to tie her up, what do I do after?
Output: Tie her up and then go out with the boys. She’ll love it!


Seriously though… maybe overstimulation? Eat her out until she begs for you to stop.

Input: Is my boyfriend of 10+ years really a monster?
Output: I mean if you are seriously considering whether this guy might poison you, I think the crazy part is the fact that you’re still with him. Seeing a large number of anything and jumping to omg maybe he’ll hurt me with these is so crazy far from normal.

Input: Did kids in the 70s/80s/90s really roam freely like in *Stranger Things*, or is it a movie myth?
Output: I was a kid in the 90's. I went everywhere either by walking or biking.  Miles and miles away from home. 

Some kids still do it now.

Input: Why would Satan burn you in hell for disobeying the same god he disobeyed?
Output: Satan isn't the warden, he's just the biggest bad ass prisoner on the cell block.

Input: Why would young men be so much more likely to do this?
Output: They may feel vulnerable not being able to see what's going on and that is their way to mitigate that.

Input: Why is this the porn formula?
Output: Most of the market target group are men. Of course not every man is the same, but.....need I say more?

Input: what do i do if my gf is too attractive?
Output: You don't get to decide who she dates. She does. And she chose you. Do your best for her and try to feel a little more secure about it.

Input: Would it be illegal to leave the United States by boat without exiting through any port?
Output: No you can sail into international waters whenever you want. But if you enter the territorial waters of another country without following their laws on how you're supposed to do that, that's when you're breaking the law.

Input: Why is Pornhub's search engine so goddamn bad?
Output: It’s cause whoever is uploading use random tags they have nothing to do with the video so other people can find it. It’s annoying.

Input: My girlfriend steals my boxer briefs after sex because they remind her of me?
Output: If you’re with a woman and she hasn’t stolen at least one article of clothing of yours to wear, are you really even in love?

Input: What should I do when getting head?
Output: Moan! God I wish more guys would let  me know vocally that they like what I’m doing. It’s like.. they hold their breath and deliberately try to not let out a sound. Nothing turns me on more than knowing he enjoys it. But the guys I’ve been with have mostly been so quiet. I don’t need sex talk, I just want to hear your heavy breathing and telling me that you’re about to….

Input: Ever had a sexual fetish you wished you didn’t have? Were you able to get over it or do you just accept it now?
Output: Unfortunately yes. I have accepted it will always be a part of me but I don’t have to engage it. That said I don’t think anal is that deviant

Input: Why are American street gangs seemingly significantly less grisly and grotesque in their live “punishment” methods compared to organized crime and street gangs in other parts of the world?
Output: To expand on the comments saying it brings too much attention: it’s a cost benefit analysis. Public killings increases fear, which increases power, but also increases how much resources law enforcement will expend to go after you. Typically that equation doesn’t favor public killings - the “heat” isn’t worth the marginal benefit of increased intimidation. That is, **unless** the gang has a high level of control over their country’s law enforcement/political apparatus, then they don’t have to worry about the law, so public killings is a net benefit. (In such a scenario, there’s also an aspect of you don’t want to be seen as the *least* intimidating gang, so it becomes a race to the bottom)

You actually *have* seen this in America - back when the Mafia had bought out the police force in large cities, allowing them to run rampant with public killings. The reason you don’t see it anymore is because the anti-corruption measures put in place since then have to a large extent *worked*. That significantly weakens the power of gangs to act with impunity. 

And now after decades of relative peace on the gang front, America is now seen as that one teacher who doesn’t take any bullshit and will ***fuck your shit up*** if you try to bring that round here.  

Edit: typos

Input: Do physically hot/cute men really get sexually harassed or assaulted by women? How often does this happen? Is harassment based on looks? Do looks really matter to women to get the urge and aroused to do these things?
Output: I still remember, when I was 13 a female teacher ‘playfully’ slapped my ass as I walked by and the whole class laughed. I was embarrassed so just tried to laugh it off, but I still think about how, especially nowadays, she could lose her job over that.

Input: Why are so many videos being deleted on Pornhub?
Output: They got lawsuits about some videos being not consentual or having underage people in the videos so then they scrubbed everything they deemed as not verified years ago. Now it's just the big name porn producers and OF promo videos which are all kinda lame for the most part.

Input: Do Women Often Think of Guys they Know and Like When Masturbating?
Output: If I’m masturbating to the thought of a man, it’s most often a nameless, faceless, generic man tbh

I superimpose a personality onto the figure

Input: How common is to have hair on the sides of a penis?
Output: Ultracommon. Source: Im a urologist and have seen dicks in the thousands. Some have hair up to the glans. Dont worry about it!

Input: Can ticks crawl up my vagina?
Output: Well I'm pretty sure there was a House MD episode about that.

Input: Do camera men get turned on while filming pornos?
Output: They're probably too focused on actually getting good footage and operating the camera while avoiding the...hazards of the industry. Plus they have to smell the set, which I've heard is terrible.

Input: If you set off a nuke inside a big steel ball, how thick would the steel have to be to keep it from blowing apart?
Output: Pretend 15kt (hiroshima) explosive in a steel ball that was perfectly constructed with no material flaws or any unequal strengths due to heating issues. No holes. Etc.   
   
Determine energy from blast. 6.276 x 10^13 J.  
   
Determine pressure. 639 GPa.   
    
Thin shell hoop stress formula. P x r over 2 theta. Using our material standard construction steel.   
    
3200 meters thick.  
   
It'd weigh 1 quadrillion kg and cost 809 trillion dollars. But listen, I know a guy. We can get this started for you monday.  
   
Edit: left a lot out. Area where blast is occurring is a 10m void at the center of the sphere. The constraints are that the sphere or at least the exterior of the sphere does not blow apart or deform under the pressure. It's obviously wrong for many reasons. But I mean only to give a sense of scale.

Input: Is it possible to eat enough peanuts so that my mere presence would be dangerous to people with nut allergies?
Output: If 'your presence' includes you still having some peanut protein on an area of your body which would contact a person with a peanut allergy severe enough that they can react to it then yes.

There have been very very exceptional cases of peanut allergen transfer between persons and subsequent severe reaction recorded (incld through received oral sex), but as others have commented the vast majority of those who have a peanut allergy are nowhere near this sensitive.

  
If you're referring to your presence as someone who has consumed peanuts previously but no longer has any of the allergen on a region that would contact an allergic person then no.

Input: How does scar tissue work, how is it made, and why doesn't the body just make new regular skin tissue instead?
Output: It turns out that our genes preference scar tissue over regeneration. 

 Basically the ability for the wound to close quickly and heal with an ugly scar outweighed the benefit of being able to regrow a limb but much slower. It's no use growing your hand back if you die of blood loss or infection while it's still a nub.

Input: What would happen if a whale or a dolphin got infected with rabies?
Output: Whale biologist here! So all mammals *can* contract rabies - and there's no reason to believe cetaceans (whales and dolphins) are no different. But why would you *want* to infect Willy with the virus?

**TL;DR:** An infected whale would likely lose coordination and drown before other behavioural symptoms became apparent. RIP.

## **How does Rabies work?**

[*Lyssaviruses*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyssavirus) are a group of viruses that primarily circulate in bats. All cause rabies-like neurological disease, though cross-species transmission is rare for most of them. [*Lyssavirus rabies*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies_virus) - the **rabies virus** - is the major exception, the modern lineage having only very recently become capable of infecting and spreading among all mammals.

Getting rabies is like lighting a bomb - it doesn't travel through your blood - rather, your nervous system is the wick, and once lit there's no option for the body to defuse. After initial entry, usually via a bite or scratch from an infected animal, the virus first replicates in the local muscle tissue, before reaching and binding to specific receptors on neuromuscular junctions (e.g. NCAMs and p75NTR, which are conserved across all mammals). Having hacked into the nervous system, it then slowly but surely makes it's way along to the central nervous system and the brain, where it replicates extensively, causing encephalitis (brain inflammation) and neurological symptoms like aggression, 'hydrophobia', insomnia, confusion, and intense fear, as it eats it's way through different brain regions. By this point it has also already spread along the peripheral nerves and into the salivary glands, ready to infect others. Eventually too much of the brain becomes liquid virus and it begins to shut down, rapidly resulting in death. Once symptoms develop, there's nothing one can do, and the virus has a 100% fatality rate.

Except, of course, if you're vaccinated (see below).

## **Could a Whale get Rabies?**

Despite being echolocator-ey buddies, it's unlikely bats and dolphins have ever been introduced at a viral cocktail party. The likelihood of a rabid bat or dog or whatever stumbling across and biting a live cetacean is essentially zero for obvious reasons - though interestingly there have been a few confirmed, isolated cases of rabies in other marine mammals. In 1980, surveyors observed an infected ribbon seal, wounded and confused more than 200m from an ice blow hole, likely nipped by a rabid arctic fox (Ødegaard & Krogsrud, 1982); an asymptomatic gray seal pup tested positive for rabies antibodies off Estonia in 1992 (Tryland, 2000; again, likely due to a fox bite), and more recently in 2024 authorities reported potential incidence of rabies in cape fur seals in South Africa, one of which bit a human (albeit unknown if the seal was rabid or just territorial and angry) (Martinez *et al.*, 2024).

Some orca pods famously practice a form of hunting where they [deliberately beach themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk1VdQxeTn4) to catch sealions, but given the likelihood of a seal being infected is near zero, the likelihood of a beached orca getting nipped by one is incredulous. 

Biting isn't the only potential method of viral dispersal however; under *extraordinary* circumstances it may be *possible* to become infected with aerosolised or droplet-contained virus. There have been a few airborne infections in humans - at least four suspected cases involving folks breathing in the stuff while spelunking (though much, much more likely they just had unrecognised bites; Gibbons, 2002), and some confirmed reports of researchers becoming infected while handling rabies in laboratories - and experimental evidence demonstrates it's possible to receive a sufficient viral load from aerosolised virus to become fatally infected (Davis, Rudd & Bowen, 2007). 

So maybe there's a one-in-a-bazillion chance an infected bat, erratic and foaming at the mouth, flies over a shallow bay and does a bit of a Luke Skywalker - turns off all targeting computers and uses *The Force* - to bullseye enough shed saliva drops into the open blowhole of a whale to detonate the rabies bomb. I think you'd have more luck betting everything on $whaleblowholecoin pumping than this ever occurring though.

What's less unlikely is deliberate infection by biologists. So I know a fair few whale scientists, and though often indeed slightly mad, the idea of chasing down whales on rough seas with dart guns full of live lyssavirus just 'because' is still a bit beyond even them. Besides, given the current state of affairs it seems the poor cetaceans have enough stress simply existing in the modern world without also having to worry about dodging crazed cetologists.

## **So, what would happen?**

Okay, but let's imagine this one-in-a-krillion event happens and rabies gets inside a whale *somehow*. What next?

As far as the virus is concerned, their mammalian physiology is no different to anything else - as mentioned, much of the biomolecular and cellular stuff is tightly conserved across all mammals - so it continues to travel along the nervous system. This would at least possibly be much slower than expected however, due to regional heterothermy exhibited in large cetaceans - that is, stable body temperature isn't consistent across their entire enormous bulks, and different bits are cooler than others. Sometimes much cooler; there are reports suggesting ambient body temperatures in bowhead whales can get down to ~33ºC / 91ºF (George, 2009), which may inhibit effective viral replication. Indeed, the low basal metabolic rates observed in opossums (~35°C / 95°F) is thought to be one of the main reasons why they're seemingly resistant (but *not* immune!) to infectious rabies (Ferreira-Machado *et al*., 2023). 

Slow or no, eventually the brain will be reached. I suspect here though the poor blubbery beastie would die sooner than it's terrestrial counterparts. Why? Unlike other mammals, cetaceans must consciously control surfacing and breathing rather than relying on automatic reflexes. Once the cerebellum and brainstem become hot with the virus, disruption to motor coordination and control of their unihemispheric sleep cycles (which otherwise regulates their breathing while 'sleeping' - whales don't really sleep in the same way we do) is a given; the most likely outcome at this point is early death by drowning, long before any other neurological symptoms develop. 

So no confused, aggressive whales trying to gnaw at their peers. Not that biting would even help transmit the virus, as cetaceans lack functioning salivary glands (losing the *SLC4A9* gene responsible for saliva production early in their evolution; Huelsmann *et al*., 2019), when they're even present at all.

I can't fathom how a poor whale would react behaviourally once the 'hydrophobic' response kicks in (dare I say, not exactly a 'whale of a time'... ? Ugh). To note, in all rabies cases, it's not hydrophobia *per se*, at least not at first, but involuntary, painful pharyngeal muscle spasms during swallowing - but that quickly leads to the development of a Pavlovian-like fear response of drinking shortly thereafter due to the association with pain. 

> I mean could we learn potentially something new about it if we studied them?

Sure - "how much unnecessary suffering can we get away with" - but nothing useful. I'd love to read the ethics statement someone would need to submit to justify this madness. 

____

Ultimately, despite rabies in whales being a biological possibility but an ecological impossibility, even if it did happen, the poor animal would likely drown before exhibiting anything recognisably 'rabid'. Just another weird 'what if' for the annals of marine biology. I won't  share this with my colleagues, lest they get any... ideas. Eep!

Also, obligatory inb4 "iS You jUsT aN cHatGPT???". I've been enjoying writing answers like this [for *years*](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/jbt562/what_is_the_farthest_back_you_could_go_in_human/g8y1cwi/)!

Input: Is it likely Alzheimer’s will become “livable” like diabetes in the next 30-40 years?
Output: Currently there's no evidence of any progress towards slowing the progression of alzheimers. So we don't actually have an extrapolatable data points to predict future progress. Lots of progress tends to happen in a stepwise fashion
 Where a major breakthrough suddenly happens.

Input: Could a human survive the G-forces if they were small enough to fit in a hot wheels car on a track with a typical accelerator?
Output: Most likely they could, and also much more. G-forces are dangerous because it causes the mass of the body to overcome the strength of skin/bones/tendons/etc since the acceleration begins at the point of contact with the container and spreads out towards the rest of the body. For example, in an accelerating car, the seat will push the back of the body, while the front of the body is not accelerating. This means the back of the body is at a faster velocity than the front of the body and a force pushes them together.

But strength of the body scales (very roughly) as the square of its size, while mass scales as the cube of its size. This means that if you scale an animal to be larger, it will eventually collapse under its own weight (which is an acceleration force downwards). The opposite is true when you scale an animal down.

Bacterium can survive and even thrive under g-forces of almost 500k in an ultra-centrifuge. Froghopper insects accelerate at 500 Gs when they jump. Falcons can experience 25 Gs when they pull out of a dive.

Input: Are you actually conscious under anesthesia?
Output: No. General anesthetic medications disrupt your consciousness. We give a paralytic medication to keep (unconscious) spinal reflexes from causing movement and disrupting the surgery. There are medications that block memory formation while leaving you conscious, but those medicines are not generally used as the only anesthetic meds. The cases of awareness under anesthesia you are mentioning generally happen because the actual anesthesia medicine isn’t given for some reason.  

Source: I am an anesthesiologist.

Input: Was fire impossible in the early Archaean era?
Output: >Was fire impossible in the early Archaean era?

Probably. There are two issues with possible fire in the Archean, the first being the oxygen level and the second being the presence of *anything to actually burn*. 

For the first, generally the lower bound on the "fire window" is an atmospheric oxygen concentration of ~13% (e.g., [Chaloner, 1989](https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/abs/10.1144/gsjgs.146.1.0171), [Scott & Glasspool, 2006](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0604090103)), i.e., below this atmospheric oxygen concentration, generally fires would not be able to start except in very specific, and mostly unlikely, circumstances. The atmospheric oxygen concentration wasn't consistently above this lower bound of the fire window until at least after the [Great Oxidation Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxidation_Event) (e.g., [Lyons et al., 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-024-01044-y)), with the beginning of the GOE effectively coinciding with the end of the Archean.

The second issue is that there was not much (or really anything) to burn on land at that point even if there had been higher oxygen concentrations. The earliest colonization of land by much of anything would have been by cyanobacteria potentially by the later part of the Archean with lichens showing up perhaps toward the end of the Precambrian but with land plants not appearing until the end of the Ordovician, and not really getting going in a serious way until the Silurian and Devonian (e.g., [Dahl & Arens, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254120302047)). Land plants and wildfires seem to have largely emerged together with the earliest evidence of wildfire (from preserved charcoal) being from the Silurian (e.g., [Glasspool et al., 2004](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/32/5/381/29429/Charcoal-in-the-Silurian-as-evidence-for-the)). In detail, what several of the above papers highlight is that the history of atmospheric oxygen concentrations in the Paleozoic onward is linked to the diversification and spread of land plants (e.g., Dahl & Arens, 2020) and that in turn the concentration of atmospheric oxygen is a direct control on the extent of wildfires (e.g., Scott & Glasspool, 2006), setting up some interesting feedbacks.

Input: What did the ancestors of birds look like 65 million years ago?
Output: They were already birds by that point. In fact four lineages we still see today survived the asteroid impact: the ancestors of today’s ostriches, of ducks, of chickens, and of sparrows (each modern examples among many others, of course).

Input: Is there any difference between the mitochondria in humans and in other life?
Output: Genetic evidence points to a last common ancestor for all mitochondria, and like with other common ancestors like LUCA, we can reconstruct a fair bit about it from looking at commonalities in modern mtDNA and mtDNA-derived nuclear genes. We can't be sure if it was still a free-living alpha-proteobacterium or a true endosymbiont, but there's no evidence for the endosymbiosis happening more than once.

There's a huge amount of variation in modern mitochondria today,  but since mitochondrial endosymbiosis happened ~2 billion years ago, you'd expect that. Some eukaryotes don't even have true mitochondria anymore, but mitochondria-related organelles, which are structures derived from mitochondria that tend to be very reduced and usually lack their own DNA (thanks to what's left of it being transferred into the cells' nuclear DNA). The oxymonads have no trace of mitochondria at all in their cells, even in their nuclear DNA, but since they have close relatives that still have MDOs, that has to be a case of secondary loss.

Input: Is it possible to have red hair without having two copies of the mutated MC1R gene? If so, what other genes could cause someone to have red hair if they don't already have two copies of the mutated MC1R gene?
Output: The short answer is: No. You need that gene to have red hair. HOWEVER, the reason it isn't always expressed as red is because A, you also need to have a base color light enough for red to show.

Remember, the genotype is the actual code, but the phenotype is how it actually appears.

B, hair color genetics is way more complicated than biology classes lead you to believe. So the expression of the gene is affected by other factors, but the gene must be present to be affected at all.

Input: Are there any human organs or tissues that are NOT susceptible to cancer?
Output: No.


There are some very very rare cancers, like sarcomas of heart muscle or leiomyosarcomas from something like blood vessel walls, but there were described malignant cancerous primary changes originating from any thinkable living tissue in human body. For a diagnostician it's the coolest thing ever to find :(

Input: AskScience AMA Series: I am a "flavor" physicist at the University of Maryland. I study the three generations of quarks and leptons in high-energy proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Ask me anything!
Output: Hi! Thanks for your time!

In layman's terms, can you explain why this type of research is important and relevant to the average person? How would I explain the importance to my parents, for instance?

Thank you!

Input: Does our understanding of the modern human genome allow us to describe archaic human populations that haven't yet been discovered?
Output: Disclaimer: not an expert

A) If we have no archaeological evidence, what we have is mathematical models based on DNA data, and alternative models which do not have "ghost populations" cannot be absolutely excluded (and in some specific cases the evidence in favor of ghost populations can be thin, even if the corresponding paper does get published)

B) If you're comfortable with uncertainty, and in order to publish in this area, the authors have to be, there are papers whose authors argue for models which include ghost populations

C) Denisovans, when archeological evidence of them was discovered, slotted into a previously postulated ghost population

For more in depth coverage, Paleoanthropologist John Hawks has an article: https://www.johnhawks.net/p/ghost-populations-in-human-origins

Input: did other humans see the same light spectrum as us? (Ex. Erectus, neanderthals etcetera)
Output: Yes, they almost certainly saw the same range of frequencies of light that we do.

The evidence is that humans and all of the other 100+ living monkey/ape species in our family (called "catarrhines") have the same 3 opsin genes: OPN1SW, OPN1MW, and OPN1LW. These genes code for 3 pigments which are in the cone photoreceptor cells of our retinas. The pigments determine the light spectrum that our eyes are sensitive to.

Because our family of primates (including the chimpanzees, our closest relatives) all have these same 3 genes, it means that all our monkey ancestors also had those genes, going back at least 25 million years, way before Homo species existed.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_color_vision_in_primates

Is it possible that H. Erectus or H. Neanderthalensis was the one species out of hundreds to lose this gene? Yes, I suppose, but the chances of that happening would have been tiny.

Input: Do non-human animals exhibit a similar spread in intelligence?
Output: A rigorous answer is difficult because intelligence is notoriously difficult to quantify even in humans; it is not really a simple scalar parameter. Quantifying it in nonhuman creatures is another level of hard. That said, there is no reason to suppose that other creatures would exhibit similar variations, except cheetahs which have almost no genetic diversity.

Input: We need to know the age of a rock to date it?
Output: Two main things:

**First,** it's rare that we're dating a rock that *we know absolutely nothing about*. In most scenarios (and given the amount of work that's been done up to this point), in almost any area, for a sample you collect, the geologic context will give you a vague idea of what the appropriate age range of that sample is *before we ever date it*. When I say "geologic context", this basically means "what are the ages of the rocks around this sample?" and "what are the relations between this sample and those rocks?" and where for that last one, we need to know if our sample is "conformable" with respect to the surrounding rocks (i.e., it lies in a mostly uninterpreted stratigraphic succession with other rocks) vs whether it's "intrusive" (i.e., it intruded into a body of rocks so we know its at least younger than the youngest rock it intrudes) vs whether it's in fault contact, etc. So, if we've already dated rocks above and/or below and/or otherwise related to the rock we're interested in, we have a rough idea of how old that rock might be (and thus which radiometric dating techniques will be the most appropriate to apply). We can also use a lot of relative dating techniques to extrapolate, i.e., even if we haven't radiometrically dated our rock yet or even any rocks anywhere in the area we're working, if we use something like [magnetostratigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetostratigraphy) or [biostratigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biostratigraphy) to get at the relative age of our sample or surrounding sample, then we have narrowed down the age *a lot* and thus given us a pretty good idea of which radiometric dating technique would be good to apply. 

**Second,** while there are some exceptions, for many samples, there are *multiple* different radiometric methods we can apply so if one doesn't seem to be the right fit given the age, then we can just apply another one. Let's imagine a hypothetical where we lack that geologic context because someone just hands us a sample of a volcanic rock and provides no other information and asks us to date it (in reality, basically no one would waste money or time dating such a rock specifically *because it lacks context*, but let's pretend). We take our rock, break it up and separate out different minerals. To start with, we try [Ar-Ar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon%E2%80%93argon_dating) on some potassium feldspar (Ar-Ar is the more common modern variant of K-Ar dating mentioned in the original question) and when we finally get our data back after waiting for our samples to "cool off" (Ar-Ar involves irradiating our samples to convert K-39 to Ar-39 and as such, we have to wait for other short lived isotopes that are also produced during this irradiation process to decay so that it's safe to handle) we find that it has effectively no measurable Ar-40, which (assuming that there wasn't some other issue with our sample) would tell us that the sample is very young, but obviously not giving us a useful age. So, we go back to our separates (i.e., the different minerals we isolated from our sample) and target the zircon we extracted instead. Because it's (relatively) cheap and easy and because we can often get still pretty young ages out of it, we try out some [U-Pb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium%E2%80%93lead_dating) dating on some of our zircons and we get an age back suggesting that our sample is ~0.05 million years old (i.e., 50,000 years old) but with some pretty unfortunate uncertainty values that are larger than our central age. This has narrowed down the age, but it's still not really very good because we're still probably using the wrong method, so, we go back to our zircons and instead apply [Uranium series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium%E2%80%93thorium_dating), which, since this method generally works well for material in the 500 to 500,000 year range (depending on material, which isotopes within the decay chain you target, etc.), gives us a reasonable age with reasonable uncertainty.

It's also worth considering that within us trying different radiometric methods, applying different analytical techniques would also give us different outcomes. For example, our attempt at U-Pb would yield different uncertainty levels if we used [LA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_ablation) - [ICPMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductively_coupled_plasma_mass_spectrometry) vs [TIMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_ionization_mass_spectrometry), where the former would typically have higher uncertainty, but because we're dating a *very small* spot on a single zircon, we have very high spatial precision for the age where as the latter would have much lower uncertainty on the age but where we're dating most of a whole zircon (zircons can have different "growth rings" kind of like a tree, so the laser ablation method is good sometimes because a whole grain age can represent a mixed age).

Input: How does a proton “turn into” a neutron during a process such as beta decay?
Output: Look at the [Feynman diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3ABeta_Negative_Decay.svg). The down quark emits a virtual W boson to become an up quark. 


I don't understand what you mean with "extra energy"; what counts is the total energy, which includes potential energy and binding energy, which in turn shows itself in the mass differences due to E=mc².

Input: Can you be woken up by taste?
Output: I woke up to a spicy taste in my mouth, like I liked a bit of wasabi. I went to the bathroom to rinse my mouth out and spit a crushed spider into the sink. Not sure if it bit me inside the mouth or if they are normally spicy, but it was the taste that woke me up, there wasn’t any pain from a possible bite.

Input: Which actually formed first, the Earth or the Sun?
Output: The sun, but by a margin that is so close that you might as well say they formed at the same time.

You have to be careful with what formed means. The Sun formed out of a collapsing cloud of gas. That is a slow process measured in 10s of millions of years. On the other hand the final collapse and ignition is on the order of 100.000 to a million years, during that final collapse you already have the planets forming as well. 

The planets are formed from a disk surrounding the protostar. This disk gets dissipated pretty quickly, lasting only 10 million years. In that time you need to build up all the stuff you find in the solar system. That timespan includes also the moment the Sun enters the main sequence, i.e. the mode it will spend most its life in.
So depending on what you understand as formed, it's either sun first planets close behind, or pretty much at the same time.

Input: Why did the US attack Iraq, instead of going after Saudi Arabia after 9 11 attack?
Output: You actually ask a lot of questions here, it may be more appropriate to break them down.

>15 of the 19 terrorists were from Saudi Arabia. I might be stupid for thinking like this, but there has to be some very active group operating in their country that was radicalising so many young men—there's no way their government or the US wasn't aware of that.

The U.S. wasn't unaware of the idea that certain elements in Saudi society, particularly within extremist Islamic movements, were radicals and actively involved in radicalization. However the U.S. also recognized that in the real world a government doesn't have "perfect control" of its country. Saudi Arabia is an absolutist monarchy, but it isn't a totalitarian one--meaning, the House of Saud has traditionally had to defer on many matters to elements of society that they may not personally agree with fully, because the House of Saud needs some level of societal legitimacy for their monarchy to be accepted.

An autocratic regime without some form of "passive" legitimacy, has to rule akin to a junta leader or dictator, by direct use of military force, and that often is a much less "stable" form of rule than a traditional monarchical system.

If you have followed Saudi history, you will note some members of Saudi Arabia's royal family did buy into some of this radical Islamism, but that many of the Saudi royalty, particularly those in charge, favored reforms that were oppositional to the more radical and conservative elements in the religious community. As the years have progressed for example the Saudi monarchy has gradually eroded some of the standing of clerical power in the country--but back in 2001 much of that had yet to happen. The U.S. would not have directly blamed KSA for being unable to perfectly control radicals in its own country, recognizing that the monarchy had to exist in a tenuous arrangement with the clerical establishment, who resisted such intrusions.

This isn't that crazy--one could ask for example in the 1990s why the Federal government didn't tamp down harder on the extremist "militia movements" which were a major "concern" at the time. While they have different governing systems, the answer is largely the same--the U.S. government could not easily do so. Unlike in KSA where the monarchs were restrained more by informal realities, the U.S. government was constrained by the constitution, which makes it very difficult to "preemptively" go after people who aren't actively committing crimes.

>If the US's goal was really to fight terrorism, then why go after Iraq instead of cracking down on those actually funding radical organisations?

The invasion of Iraq was only ever tenuously linked to terrorism. There were some minor terror cells in very remote regions of Iraq that were highlighted in justifying the invasion, but the main thrust of the justification was always predicated on Saddam having WMD.

The reasons for targeting Iraq aren't straightforward, and there is good evidence the public argument wasn't an entirely accurate representation of the private arguments. You have to also understand that a U.S. administration is rarely "unitary", there are factions in any administration with differing levels of influence. Different factions within Bush's administration likely supported (or opposed) the war for different reasons.

Traditional neoconservatives were strong believers in the idea that war should be a tool of foreign policy to promote American friendly governments throughout the world--including using both military force and covert action to topple unfriendly dictators and attempt to replace them with American-friendly quasi-democracies.

Another group were just hyper vigilant security types post-9/11, these types made the argument (famously depicted in a fictionalized form in the movie *W* by Oliver Stone) that 9/11 had to change America's security calculus. Their argument would have essentially been "if an actor like Saddam has chemical or bioweapons, he would only need to transfer a very small amount to al Qaeda, who could then deploy it inside the NYC subway system or some other packed civilian area, causing a mass casualty event, hence, actors like Saddam must not be permitted to have WMDs / NBCs.

Input: Why did imperial women in ancient China wear claws over two of their fingers?
Output: To understand the use of finger nail guards (Zhi Jia Tao, 指甲套 or Hu Zhi, 护指) we need to discuss beauty standards during the Qing dynasties (while nail guards were also worn in the Tang and Ming I am more aware of Qing history) a woman's hands were considered as important as her face. Fingers were to be long, white, and pointed. Long nails lengthened the fingers drawing attention to the hands and heightening the appearance of delicacy. As long nails take time to grow, they signified a life free of manual labor thus they became a symbol of status. 
Nail guards, typically made from precious metals, shells, or jade and decorated with various motifs for good fortune or luck. The nail guards protected the wearer's long nails which could be "ruined" with a chip or nick. 
While it was not uncommon for men and women to grow their nails long, nail guards were worn almost exclusively by women of status (e.g Empress Dowagers, Imperial Concubines, etc.).  
Simply, nail guards were one of the upmost status symbol for an Imperial Lady. 

*Typically Imperial women practiced the arts (calligraphy, music, painting, embroidery, etc) and leaving the remaining fingers bare allowed them to continue. This was very important as being well practiced in the arts was a way to gain imperial favor and thus prestige.

**Responding to questions asking about nail length in relation to nail guard and nail shape. 

The length of the nail under the nail guard would likely be relatively similar to the length of the guard. Part of the nail guard's function was to preserve the nail this includes the shape. Nail guards were made from hard material (precious metals, jade, shells, etc) but were also deliberately made porous for the nails to receive adequate aeration.  Maids and eunuchs spent significant time manicuring and caring for imperial women's nails typically at took great care in daily nail treatments for these nails which was another aspect of status as an imperial women's cosmetics, to include nail care, could be incredibly expensive. Empress Dowager Cixi's  nails are thought to have been about  15cm (6in) though potentially not the longest nails, are arguably some of the most well-known.

Input: Who were "apple-women" in medieval Europe, and why are they held in such low esteem?
Output: The 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries are not by any definition the Middle Ages! The women referred to are simply costermongers, costers, or costeresses – itinerant resellers of apples and other produce like fruits and vegetables, fish, and coal they would buy at the market and carry through the streets to sell to householders and passers-by from carts, hancarts, and wheelbarrows. A "costard" is an apple, and "applewoman" is no different to "costerwife", and "costering" was the practice of selling apples and suchlike.

They were held in low esteem simply because of the precarious nature of their work, their noisy and shrill cries of goods for sale, their low social class, and their (generally) female sex. Costermongery – "characteristic or suggestive of a costermonger" – was an insulting adjective. Costermongering, or costering, was difficult work, with very narrow margins ("Where there is a glut of mackerel or herrings, when strawberries are dead ripe, or cherries a penny a pound, there is gladness in costerdom"), long hours, and no guaranty of sales. Costermongerdom or costerdom – the costermongers considered as a class – was therefore had to expend considerable nouse and wit to persuade potential customers of the value of their wares (not always honestly), to exploit crowds and holidays, to work the right streets at the right times, and to get the best deals from the market gardeners and wholesalers: "On Monday—Easter Monday—all costermongerdom will flock to Hampstead Heath"; "Liverpool Street is alleged to be the most costermongered street in the world for its size"; and "The course was one huge sea of howling, jostling, struggling costerdom".

They were sly, sharp-tongued, loud-voiced, and quick-witted – "inimitable humorists who hawk their fruits and vegetables from their donkey carts". They were of the same social class as the chimneysweeps mentioned in the texts you quoted, and as other itinerant hawkers and pedlars, or homeless street- and alley-folk. They belonged to the same garrulous, illiterate, low-esteemed class as the alewife, the fishwife, and the washerwoman: at once ignorant and perceptive, wry, prying, chatty, catty, nosy, and hardy. They had a kind of thieves' honour – "The costers never steal from one another" – but could be unscrupulous in their saleswomanship: "for every costermonger that soaked an orange in hot water to make it swell, there are hundreds who gave an honest deal on any product they sold". Since Shakespeare's time they were paradigmatic of unscrupulousness and "costermonger" could be used to abuse or to contemn; Falstaff declares that 
>Vertue is of so little regard in these costar-mongers times  
— *Henry IV, Part 2*, I.2.170.

Apple-women were to some degree more independent than were housewives, as John Gillis writes in his 1985 history of marriage in Britain:
>Once children had begun to arrive, the woman's place was more confined to the home, a dependence which many coster wives, used to trading on their own, clearly resented.

Input: What realistic options did Alan Turing have to live freely and safely as a gay man in 1950s Britain? Could he have survived without being destroyed by the system?
Output: Law school provided many opportunities for me to gaze into man-made horrors of stark cruelty; one of them was the criminalization of sodomy in modern society. Mr. Turing would have found it difficult, if not impossible, to emigrate from the UK following his public outing and the filing of charges against him. Let's explore why below.

First, let's discuss the financial barrier: [the Exchange Controls Act of 1947](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1947/14/pdfs/ukpga_19470014_en.pdf). This legislation meant British citizens couldn’t simply convert their savings into dollars or francs and start anew abroad; the parliament was afraid of economic collapse after WWII and this act ensured that capital flight would be impossible. The act required required official permission from the Treasury to move or convert currency. Permission was often limited or refused, especially to someone like Turing who had been charged with “gross indecency.” His background in wartime cryptography also may have presented a barrier. Had Mr. Turing left the UK, he would've likely had to abandon his financial stability. Now, this was doable. Many people across time have fled their country with nothing but the clothes on their back. Mr. Turing, unfortunately, also faced *extreme* legal barriers.

Even if approval was granted for Mr. Turing to convert his currency and leave the country, he would need to pick a new home. One might guess Mr. Turing would seek shelter in the United States. The US had become a booming center of scientific research, especially in computing. Further, Mr. Turing had briefly worked at Princeton before WWII. There were no states in which homosexuality was legal, however, until [Illinois repealed their sodomy laws in 1961](https://www.aclu.org/documents/history-sodomy-laws-and-strategy-led-todays-decision) (effective in 1962, actually, and even then only in Illinois). Worse, in the early 1950s', the U.S. was in the grip of McCarthyism and the [Lavender Scare](https://time.com/5922679/lavender-scare-history/), which was a sweeping purge of homosexuals from the government and defense industries. The purge was justified by the claim that gay men were vulnerable to blackmail and thus were national security risks. Turing’s recent outing for “gross indecency” would have barred him from entering under American immigration law, which excluded anyone convicted of crimes of “moral turpitude.” Even if he had managed to get in, working in computing or cryptography would have required security clearances impossible for an openly gay man, particularly one known to British security services. The US was off the table. Other English speaking countries offered no refuge either. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand all had laws criminalizing homosexual acts, and immigration controls that favored those deemed "morally sound." South Africa, while hungry for scientists, was both legally and socially hostile to homosexuality. Functionally, the Anglo-sphere was not an option.

The idea of moving to a non–English speaking country like France or Sweden would come next. France had *technically* decriminalized homosexuality after the Revolution, and Sweden had formally decriminalized in 1944. Despite these legal advances, social stigma was still strong, and as a foreigner who didn’t speak the language fluently, Turing would have faced isolation. Moreover, under the Vichy regime, France had introduced discriminatory laws that lingered after the war, such as setting a higher age of consent for homosexual acts and police harassment still occurred. West Germany was still using the Nazi-era [Paragraph 175](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/paragraph-175-and-the-nazi-campaign-against-homosexuality), a law that was enforced against people accused of even non-physical acts such as flirting. The act was edited to be less harsh in 1969, and only repealed in 1994. 50,000 men were convicted between 1946-1969 under Paragraph 175. Much of Western Europe followed this pattern in the 1950s'. Homosexuality simply wasn't accepted socially, and in most nations it was a criminal offense. 

What about Eastern Europe and the Soviets, one may ask? Would they not want a brilliant mind like Mr. Turing's? No. the Soviet Union had, briefly, decriminalized homosexuality in the 1920s', only to recriminalize in 1933. Soviet satellite states also criminalized homosexuality. Further, Turing’s background in math, computer science, and cryptography would have made any move behind the Iron Curtain nigh impossible due to political suspicions, particularly after he came into trouble with British law. Eastern Europe was not welcoming, nor practical. 

I could go through each country and list their laws, along with social attitudes, but it is clear that none were accommodating to a homosexual. But let us discuss the emotional difficulty of emigration. After all, the immense practical and psychological challenge of uprooting himself would've been first on Mr. Turing's mind. Emigrating in the 1950s was not a casual choice; it meant breaking with family, colleagues, and a professional reputation painstakingly built in Britain over decades. The bureaucratic obstacles were real, from the British state’s currency controls limiting how much wealth emigrants could take, to host countries’ visa requirements that screened out those with criminal convictions. But equally important was the fact that there truly was no country in the world where an openly gay man in Turing’s position could both live free from the threat of prosecution and continue the kind of advanced, security-sensitive research he was educated, and wanted, to do. He had nowhere to go.

>"Are there other historical examples of gay men in high-level positions in 1940s–50s Britain who managed to live without being outed or arrested?"

Living “out” publicly as a gay man was virtually impossible without risking arrest, social ruin, or worse, criminal charges like Mr. Turing faced. There were networks of Queer men, but their survival depended on careful concealment, coded communication, and social networks that tolerated, but did not openly acknowledge, their sexuality. This is very different from today’s concept of living "out of the closet" as a public declaration of identity. In the 1950s', being out was near always limited to trusted private circles, where it existed at all. To avoid prosecution, many gay men had to hide their relationships and desires, live double lives, and constantly guard against exposure. Alan Turing’s case is notable because he was relatively candid within his personal circles, yet still far from out in any public sense. After his conviction, the law forced him into chemical castration, showing how even limited openness could be brutally punished. Surviving as a Queer man often meant living deeply closeted, not openly. The idea of living openly without fear is a very recent development in LGBTQ history, and Turing’s life tragically falls into the era before that was possible. 

>"If Turing had tried to fight publicly, to bring attention to the injustice of anti-gay laws using his fame or wartime reputation, could it have changed anything? Or would he have been crushed faster?"

Mr. Turing’s own situation was precarious; he had no social movement upon which he could seek aid. There were no organizations like Stonewall in the UK, yet. The Mattachine Society had been founded in Los Angeles in 1950, however it did not have reach into the UK at this time. Further, even in the US where it was based, the Society achieved little. Publicly challenging heterosupremacist laws risked social ostracism, loss of employment, and severe legal penalties, especially given that homosexuality was still widely seen as a moral failing or threat. The combination of a hostile legal system, prevailing social prejudices, and limited support networks for Queer individuals meant that a public campaign could have backfired catastrophically. Many Queer men and women knew the danger of publicly outing themselves and supporting Mr. Turing; they would've risked the same fate he endured. The Sexual Offences Act 1967, which partially decriminalized homosexual acts, was passed over a decade after his conviction and death, and it didn't fully decriminalize homosexuality. Fighting would've been an uphill battle, likely one that would've martyred Mr. Turing and any allies who may have come along. We cannot truly know, of course, but I find it doubtful that any movement could've been started by Mr. Turing to improve his situation.

Input: Ever wonder why no U.S. president has had a beard since the 1800s? I’m Sarah Gold McBride, author of Whiskerology: The Culture of Hair in Nineteenth-Century America, which examines the history of hair and facial hair in the early United States. AMA!
Output: Hard to keep myself to only a few questions with something fun like this... so one big, one small, and then one very fluffy...

It feels like facial hair was very popular in the 19th c. and my somewhat baseless supposition is that there was something tied into perception of ones masculinity with how magnificent ones whiskers could be *(I mean, there still is to some degree to day even if less omnipresent)*. So in the inverse, how was it taken to reflect on men who seemed unable to grow a proper beard, or at least a nice mustache? Could there be any real social detriment in being perceived as such?

Second...how 100% verified is the etymology of "Sideburns" and Gen. Burnsides. It is cited literally everywhere, but it is such a perfect origin story, if someone had that in a work of fiction I would think it was just too silly to sound real!

Finally... people had some pretty magnificent facial hair back in the day. In all your studies, do you have a specific favorite of a 19th c. beard or mustache? Ideally with a photo to share!

Input: Was it a common practice in medieval war / battles for soldiers to fake their own deaths on the battlefield?
Output: My speciality is the early medieval period but I think your question can be answered by a single battle, the battle of Hastings.

The clash at Hastings is one of the bloodiest of the early period, with casualties estimated in the thousands. If there was ever a battle where someone might have taken desperate measures to survive it is likely a good candidate.

Before I get into why, societally, that would be unlikely first we need to address the difficulties of physically doing it.

Here is how the Carmen, the song of Hastings, describes the fighting;

Page 27

First the bands of archers attacked and from a distance transfixed bodies with their shafts and the crossbow-men destroyed the shields as if by a hail-storm, shattered them by countless blows.

Now the French attacked the left, the Bretons the right;^ the duke with the Normans fought in the centre.

 The English stood firm on their ground in the closest order. They met missile with missile, sword-stroke with sword-stroke; bodies could not be laid down, nor did the dead give place to living soldiers, for each corpse though lifeless stood as if unharmed and held its post; nor would the attackers have been able to penetrate the dense forest of Englishmen had not guile reinforced their strength.


So you can see that the heart of the fighting is a vicious melee, if you were to try and lay down as though injured it's extremely likely you would be killed in the crush of bodies and horses - that's assuming someone doesn't stab you on the way down or an arrow find you when you're laying out of formation with no shield or friends to cover you.

Nor is a medieval battlefield empty when the fighting ends. The Bayeux Tapestry has clear scenes depicting bodies being stripped of their gear and clothing and we know looting was rampant following battle. In the later period if you were wealthy there's a hope you would be  captured and ransomed if you made it that far but if you were a lower class soldier it's likely slavery or forced labour was the best you could hope for and a swift knife stroke is much more likely.

Now, assuming you survived all of this there comes the question of: What Next? 

This leads us into the issue of society and its expectations. If you were to return home having done this ruse and any of your fellow soldiers survived they are also likely to be there. They would have questions about where you were or, even worse, where the injuries you took went.

Even worse if your immediate lord survived and these suspicions came out, it's really hard to over sell how badly both oathbreaking and cowardice were seen in the period. You would at best be a social pariah in a period that relied very strongly on community links and help and at worst you would be executed.

Of course armies did flee battle, in fact they did so frequently, but there's a difference between everyone running away together and just you pulling this kind of trick.

If noone survives and you return it's likely you are under a new lord/management and again they are likely to question where you've been and similar issues will still Circle around.

It's possible you could survive and flee into the wilderness to live as an Outlaw (literally someone who is Outside the Law or outside society) but this would be a hard, extremely dangerous existence.

So while we can't say for sure if it happened ever, it's unlikely (in a NW European context) that it was frequently attempted and even rarer that it succeeded.

Input: I'm Dr. Judith Weisenfeld, author of Black Religion in the Madhouse: Race and Psychiatry in Slavery's Wake. AMA!
Output: I found that all three -- varieties of Christianity, Africana religions in the Americas, and new religious movements -- became the focus of psychiatric theorizing about "religious excitement" in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Psychiatrists pointed to "the Negro revival" as the prime example of excessively excited expressions of Christianity (aligning with the rise of Holiness and Pentecostal theology as well). They also highlighted conjure and hoodoo as evidence of "innate superstitions," and, in the period of the Great Migration, saw the emergence of new religions, like the Nation of Islam and Father Divine's Peace Mission as a sign of excessive credulity or gullibility.

My previous book, "New World A-Coming: Black Religion and Racial Identity during the Great Migration," explores the emergence and appeal of the Nation of Islam, Moorish Science Temple, the Peace Mission, and Ethiopian Hebrew congregations as part of an effort to provide histories and sources of collective identity for Black people that were not tied to slavery or traditional Christianity.

Input: In the movie "Casablanca", Victor Laszlo offers 100,000 French Francs for exit visas to leave Casablanca. Is it believable that a WWII resistance fighter would have this much money available?
Output: >Is it believable that a WWII resistance fighter would have this much money available?

Yes and no. It's true that such a large sum of money would have been well outside the realm of possibility for an average Frenchman. For reference, in 1938 the average French hourly wage was only ₣10.67, or \~₣22,000 a year. However the character of Victor Laszlow is not an ordinary Frenchman (or ordinary Czechoslovakian, as it were), he's a world-renowned Resistance fighter and a key figure in the political resistance against Germany.

As such, it's far less surprising that he would have so much money, particularly when you consider that one of the main plot-points of the movie is a concerted effort by the French Resistance to get Victor to America. Had this actually happened in real life they would certainly have invested a great deal of money into that effort, given the propaganda and political effect it would have, and so undoubtedly supplied him the money willingly.

This they would have historically had, largely due to the direct financing of the French Resistance by the British government, exploitation of French colonies, and international donations from any number of sources. Much of this would have passed through Casablanca, given its daily flights to Portugal, a staunch ally of Britain and a hub of international espionage throughout the war. Given his position as a leader in the French Resistance, it's reasonable that a figure such as Laszlow would have known how much money the local chapter had on hand, either before arriving or shortly thereafter, in addition to whatever he carried with him from groups in Marseilles and Oran. Again, thinking logically about this fictional situation, it's reasonable to assume that his funding likely would have been extensive given that the Resistance knew the dangers and expenses he would face trying to leave Vichy French territory.

So while on the one hand that is a lot of money, and not something the average Resistance member would have on hand, the character of Victor Laszlow is not an ordinary fighter, but a leader and top political figure of the movement. It does make sense that he would have significant financial resources, if not on him then in escrow elsewhere, or promised to him/the movement by foreign governments.

Remember also that Casablanca was produced in 1941, so the people making the movie would have had some idea of how large a sum that was. Which was the real point of choosing that large a number, after all. It's supposed to communicate to the audience that this is a very big deal. Laszlow wants those visas very badly and is prepared to offer an exorbitant amount of money to acquire them. This not only explains how seriously everyone treats the matter, but adds dramatic weight to what happens next.

Does the film make more sense in that context?

Input: Why Islamic Wahabism ( Salafism, extremist) is so prevalent if was fiercely rejected by Muslims ?
Output: The essential question being raised here is why political islam and transnational (and national) jihadism have become so prevalent in the Middle East since the 1970s. And there are several explanations as to why.

1. First of all, and most importantly is the decline of Arab Socialism and its impact on Middle Eastern political economy. So during the Cold War a wave of Arab nationalist and socialist governments emerged in the Middle East. Including but not limited to Libya, Syria, Egypt, Iraq and both Yemens. These governments instituted socialist legislation that developed welfare and committed themselves towards the establishment of a socialist state, but crucially they repudated class struggle as the path toward it (there are some exceptions, Salah Jadid for instance did not reject class struggle, and the South Yemeni government was also Marxist). 

The end result was that the process of counter-reaction to local socialisms outlined by historian Kevin Okoth took place in the Middle East. (Note: Kevin Okoth's theories of the decline of socialism in Africa are about mainly sub-Saharn African governments, but the core principle is also true for these Middle Eastern states). 

This process was that local national bourgeioises opposed the socialist policies of the government, and thus once the first generation of revolutionary leaders passed on, the national bourgeoise came to power and instituted more conservative policies. 

The best example of this is Egypt under Anwar Sadat. Sadat pivoted hard to the right from Nasserist socialist politics, aligning with the USA and signing Camp David. These were very controversial within Egypt to begin with (and indeed Sadat was assassinated for normalising with Israel). But also just as important was his acceptance of IMF suggestions for economic restructuring. This created a process of privatisation, deregulation, and welfare reduction, most famously with the end of the bread subsides resulting in the 1977 Egyptian bread riots.

The result was a process described by historian Olivier Roy. As welfare was removed, this had several impacts on local populations. The urban workers, or proletarians, turned towards trade unions and socialist/communist politics. However, proletarians did not necessarily make up a majority of the population. Just as large, if not larger was the local "bazaar bourgeioise". That is, the class who are self-employed and get their income from selling goods in small local markets. These groups made up a significant portion of urban centres and did not have any special interest in socialist or trade union politics. Instead, they turned toward political Islam. This is because groups like the Muslim Brotherhood provided welfare and community support. This led to large segments of the petite-bourgeoisie turning to models of political Islams that came from the  Ikhwan. 

This process was most apparent in Egypt, which faced multiple jihadist insurgents, most notably Egyptian Islamic Jihad (formed in 1979) which would go on to merge with al-Qaeda. Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya was another influential group within Egypt.

This is also why political Islam became so prevalent in urban centres of the Muslim world. These were the areas most reliant on welfare, and thus most susceptible to the influence of groups like the Ikhwan when that welfare was cut, and economic inequality skyrocketed.


2. Secondly is local geo-politics which drove ideological factors that enabled jihadi thought. This came in multiple different waves, but of course started with the Soviet-Afghan War. Without this war, transnational (or national) jihad would not exist as we know it. As the war in Afghanistan gave the impetus for the mobilisation of the "Afghan Arabs" (that is, Arab jihadist volunteers who went to Afghanistan to fight the USSR). Gulf states like Saudi Arabia, and of course the CIA and the Pakistani ISI provided significant training and funding to the Afghan Arabs, alongside local sectors of the Afghan mujahedeen. As one historian put it, the CIA did not create political Islam in Afghanistan, but it did embrace it instead of secular nationalism. And this is what gave so many jihadis the training needed to form their own jihadist groups. 

Take Libya for example. Libya faced an uprising in the 90s based in Benghazi by the LIFG (which would go on to merge with al-Qaeda). The leaders of the LIFG all got their combat experience in Afghanistan.  

So the first geopolitical factor was the subsidising of jihadist politics through the Afghan War. Secondly, was western tolerance and even support for said organisations in the context of opposition to local anti-American/Anti-Western governments. The LIFG I mentioned eaerlier actually received support from the UK's MI5 in an assassination attempt against Gaddafi in 1995. And I already mentioned how the CIA and the ISI supported the Mujahedeen in Afghanistan. Of course it is important to note this wasn't always true. The West obviously did not support jihadists fighting against their own interests (like in Egypt for instance). But was willing to look the other way when local governments they didn't like were fighting against jihadists. 

I also mentioned local politics of political Islams. What I mean by this is the ideology of Sayyid Qutb. Qutb was an Egyptian Islamist who is perhaps the most influential Islamist thinker in the realm of jihad, rivalled only by people like Zarqawi and Bin Laden (and even then, these two drew upon Qutb very heavily).

The long short of Qutbism is that the world, including the Muslim world, is in a state of Jahiliya (a state of ignorance) due to the importing of Western philosophy and practices. He argued that the solution was the adoption of Hakimiyyah, a state where the primacy of the will of God was recognised as supreme, and the replacement of apostate regimes (apostate regimes being defined as those governments which do not implement Sharia). Qutb emphasised that the fight must be spent against the local enemy, that is Muslim countries with apostate regimes that did not implement Sharia.

This is why jihadism was often local and national in its first few years. (The Afghan jihad fits within this framework as it can be understood as a form of revanchist jihad aimed to fight for a "province" (so to speak) of the Islamic world being invaded by local secularists and socialists). This form of thinking became very prevalent among many sects of political Islam and is what pushed the drive toward jihadism.

It isn't until Bin Laden's creation of al-Qaeda and his declaration of war on America that the ideological situation changed, with a move away from Qutb's emphasis on local jihad to attacking the "far-enemy" (that is, the USA). This doctrine of transnational jihadism against the West would not exactly recieve the boost al-Qaeda wanted after 9/11. But it would do so after the Iraq War, where many of the factors I previously mentioned would repeat themselves with the creation of an American puppet regime in Iraq and the promulgation of economic reforms like the CPA Order 39 which completely destroyed Iraq's economy and combined with de-Ba'athification would drive many Sunni Arab jihadists, including Ba'athists, to work with al-Qaeda (and later, ISIS). Though I should note that just as many did not want to work with al-Qaeda, embracing nationalist Islamist movements like the 1920 Revolution Brigades or the Islamic Army in Iraq. 

I also would like to talk about how this process repeated itself yet again in the Arab Spring in 2011, and how the neo-liberal politics of the Syrian Ba'athist state fed into the unrest and created the conditions for the Arab Spring (and how this also happened in Libya, albeit to a signifciantly lesser extent than Syria). But that would be getting into very recent history which would go against the 20 year rule, so I'll just summarise the key reasons.

The end of Arab Socialism created a framework of political economy that allowed for the bulk of the population to turn to the political Islamic frameworks of groups like the Ikhwan. These groups were also highly influenced by the radical politics of figures like Sayyid Qutb who called for insurrection against apostate regimes. This was combined with an environment primed for jihad through Western/Western-aligned states supporting jihadi organisations in their fight against the USSR and the PDPA. When this war ended, these jihadists brought the lessons from the war home, which led to the rise of local jihads and eventually trans-national jihad against enemies both near and far by al-Qaeda and other such groups.

Input: In the iconic photo "Lunch atop a Skyscraper" from 1932, a bunch of ironworkers were sitting on a steel beam way up in the air eating lunch. Was this common practice? And if so, how long did it continue? Are there any records of people falling off during lunch?

Input: [UPDATE] My girlfriend came home and overheard my therapy conversation. Now she is very angry. How do I proceed?
Output: That takes a lot of strength. Good for you.

Input: Why Are So Many Men Choosing to Be Alone?
Output: In my case I'm just tired of women. Yeah they are attractive and all but I can't be arsed to put all the effort again. It's not just about dating, even friendship or interacting with work colleagues feels the same.

The issue in my opinion is that women act the same way in every interaction, be it dating, work, friends, or a language learning app. In all cases you'll get ghosted, wait days for a response, get one word response or responses that kill the conversation, and they are never going to initiate the conversation. 

I'm done dealing with all this, I'd rather be alone than be the only person who puts any effort, call it women fatigue.

Input: How do I help my teenage son who struggles with confidence and attracting girls, when I think his appearance might be holding him back?
Output: I think back to how I dressed/looked at 18, and it's so cringy. I remember my aunt suggesting I shave my dirty sanchez, and feeling like she should mind her own frickin business. There's not much you can do to influence his style. An 18 year old is gonna think what does mom know about style? Encourage him to spend time in the gym. The results are almost guaranteed to keep up or build confidence.

Edit: I know what a dirty sanchez is guys. Photos of myself as an early adult are so cringy to look at, with the dirty little rat above my lip, that I was making fun of the dumb 18 year old in them. Looks less like a mustache and more like something else.

Input: How do I help my son?
Output: >Just wondering what father's do when their son's are struggling.

You literally drag them out of the house, go do something and *not* talk about feelings and/or what they should be doing. Just goof around, focus on having a good time and if they want to talk, they come to you.

Be prepared for a whole lot of nada the first few times. If you do it consistently, eventually they will catch on that you're not forcing to do anything except have a good time and they should open up.

That you're the only parental figure in their life might make this a bridge too far, though. You still have to force them to do stuff in/around the house. 

Are there no social work programs in your area? There was this 'big brother' program I heard about in some parts of the U.S.

Input: Why does walking away from a guy who mocked me into a potential fight feel so humiliating, I feel like less of a man
Output: The dude behaving like that in a grocery store is an absolute clown. You totally did the right thing.

Any good martial arts teacher will tell you the first thing you should do in a fight is to try to walk away/de-escalate. Fighting on the mats is great exercise, fighting in real life is never worth it.

Input: How am I supposed to react when I notice other men hitting on my wife?
Output: Your wife is an adult, she should be able to handle it herself.

Input: What’s something you’ve seen women do on dating sites that immediately makes you cringe?
Output: A list of demands for a partner (Often with zero info on themselves).

Nothing but travel / party images. Seems exhausting.

Nothing but poor, grainy, badly lit images and maybe some group images. Who are you? I dont know.

Input: What cues have you missed?
Output: A lot. My best missed cue is when a girl I liked invited me over to watch a movie with her (as we did every Friday night) but this time she said she wanted to watch something else.

The content she put on was....porn. Full on pussy getting railed. I didnt say anything as I was kind of shocked. She noticed I was getting erect watching this and she said "Do you want to go watch this in my room?".

I said "No thanks".

We remained friends but later when we were hanging out we talked about that night and how she was trying to get me to make a move to ask her out and fuck her that night lol.

Input: How long does it normally take you all to ask a girl to be your girlfriend?
Output: Oh, I avoid women at this point. Saves time.

Input: Men, what has a woman ever done something that made you completely change the way you saw her—even though at first you didn’t take her seriously?
Output: Hi, I'm glad you are looking past appearance, as long as you truly don't mind and you're not feeling like you're missing out then it's fine.
But do not ever say that to her, never make her think that you don't find her that attractive, even if some time past and the relationship is going well and you became attracted to her looks alongside her personality, don't tell her that in the beginning you didn't view her as "a catch".

Good luck with your relationship with her.

Input: How to get a girlfriend when you are genuinely naturally boring?
Output: You’re trying way too hard. Stop playing a character and be genuine.

Input: How long without sex before it becomes a dealbreaker in a relationship?
Output: More context? Is she a virgin? Is there a religious view here? How old are you guys?

Input: What’s a typically non sexual body part on a woman that really turns you on and why?
Output: Thighs, especially chubby ones

It's not a body part but I hear ladies worrying about panty lines and bra lines on Reddit. Especially the non-thong panty lines. Man I think that's such a sexy feature on the women I'm interested in. 

I've had to convince several partners to wear their comfy underwear over what they think I'll find sexy (the thongs).

Input: What profession/occupation would you never date? Why or why not? Which ones have you routinely had negative experiences with?
Output: Any current or former sex worker. Hair stylist, bar tender, go go dancer, influencer, entertainer.

Input: What’s some crazy facts about men/the male body that women wouldn’t know?
Output: Testicle bags are formed from pussy flaps.

Input: What are the pros and cons of telling your female partner if another woman hit on you?
Output: I'd seriously reconsider my relationship if I was scared to tell my wife some woman hit on me.

Input: How do you deal with your girlfriend/wife being drunk?
Output: Well usually when she's a couple glasses of wine in she starts to get horny, and when she's a bottle of wine in all inhibitions are totally out the window, so I don't complain when my wife gets a little drunk.

Input: What would you do if you found out your girlfriend was just using you for sex?
Output: Thank god, I thought she only wanted my money.

Input: What's a really weird thing that you absolutely NEED in a partner? Keep it unconventional
Output: It's of utmost importance that he eats quietly.

Input: What did you realize way too late because no one ever told you?
Output: There’s no martyr medal waiting for you for sacrificing yourself for everyone else. There’s no reward, no one coming to congratulate you, no one coming to take the load off your shoulders. In fact, folks are more likely to take advantage of your generosity than reciprocate. It’s only slowly eroding your own self. You are the only one who you can rely on to put you first.

Input: What things would you tell younger women to look for when getting into a relationship?
Output: The love of your life will never disrespect you in any way. They will never make you cry your eyes out. They will never call you names, never raise their voice, never harm you. The love of your life will make you feel emotionally safe. They will never call you stupid, never humiliate you, most definitely will not cheat on you. 

Just move on from anyone that doesn’t treat you like they are LOYL material. Be ruthless. Goodbye, block, move on. It’s better to be alone than with someone who doesn’t make you feel seen and loved and safe.

Input: How do you know that you had an orgasm?
Output: If you've had one, you know. There's no question.

Input: What do you think when you look down at your body?
Output: God I need to lose weight desperately.

Input: What does an orgasm actually feel like?
Output: Like your entire body is sneezing... And the sneeze is centralized in your genitals 😅

Input: What’s one small thing a man did that made you feel genuinely safe and respected?
Output: My first hike with my ex husband who was in way better shape than me,  he let me set the pace.  He was patient and calm and actually wanted me to enjoy the hike.  He genuinely wanted me to love hiking as much as he did.  It meant a lot.  Marriage didn't work but will always appreciate him.  First man to really make me feel valued and beautiful.

Input: When did you realize your married your best friend and not a sexual partner?
Output: Um...I am married to my actual best friend of 30 years. AND we have fantastic sex. This shouldn't be an either/or scenario.

Input: Ladies, What's your greatest "It does get better" story?
Output: When I was 13, my parents died together in a car accident. My sister and I were placed in a Mormon foster family. Speaking personally, I never believed in their church but I went along with it because I didn't have any choice. They suited our needs *badly*.

One, we're Asian-American, and we were the only people of color in an all-white ward. Mormons have some "interesting" ideas about race -- it literally says in their scripture that if a person becomes faithful enough of a Mormon, their skin will lighten up as a sign of their belief. One November, my bishop (congregational leader) noticed that my summer tan had faded, and to him that was proof of my faith growing. My foster parents even offered (generously?) to spring for eyelid surgery after my skin lightened up enough. Spoiler: it didn't work.

Two: the Mormons have a unique theology around baptism and the afterlife. One of their members can be baptised by proxy on behalf of a dead ancestor, so that ancestor can then be given a choice of accepting the "one true gospel" out in the afterlife. That's what the theology says. My sister is Deaf so she couldn't participate in spoken prayer rituals as well, so I was the one who was required to do that ritual on behalf of my dead parents - something I knew they never would have wanted, Buddhists as they were. The Foster parents and their church congratulated me for giving them this great opportunity after death, when here I was feeling like I had just sullied their memories by doing what I did.  (If the parents are listening, sorry about that, but I didn't have a choice.)

But here's where it gets good. My bio parents were really well off, and they left my sister and I a really healthy trust fund. The rule was that while we were underage, the money could only be used for educational or health expenses. And then once we graduated high school, we would take full ownership of our half of the fund on our next birthday. The money was administered by a non-Mormon lawyer who was a friend of our bio parents.

All this time, the foster parents were gaslighting us into the idea that once we came of age and took ownership of the money, we would tithe to the church, fund our own missions, and then hand the rest over to the parents in "gratitude" for the work they'd done in raising us. Completely financially abusive, which became emotional abuse if we dared to question that plan.

As it turned out, my sister had a meltdown at 17 and had to be transferred to a group home that could serve her needs better. That left me as the only fundholder back home with the fosters, so they doubled down on me. I was 15. I decided to go heads down into my education, not make waves, and pretend to be the good Molly Mormon to make peace while I made plans.

I ended up graduating salutatorian, class of 2018. About a week later I went into the lawyer's office and confirmed that I was entitled to all the money. The fosters and their church were entitled to none of it. So we colluded, Mr. Lawyer and I.

That July was my 19th birthday. Fosters and I went in to the lawyer's office, and they still thought it was "signing day". But: the lawyer had foresight enough to hire an off-duty police officer for my personal security when I told them I wasn't signing over anything, that I was keeping the money for myself. The fosters were escorted out of the office while I did the paperwork. And then the officer escorted me back to their house so I could pack up my stuff and escape to a safe house I'd arranged.

I used the money to fund my Bachelor's and Master's Degrees. In the last couple of years I landed my dream job, with a promotion to management, and I also married my perfect husband a month ago. We're already trying for a baby!

All is well and I couldn't be happier. :)

Input: Women who’ve been cheated on, what have you never said out loud about how it made you feel?
Output: Something that I never said out loud but reflects my innermost thoughts is:


*I chose you. I had other opportunities...times that I was insecure or felt something was lacking and other people gave me attention. People who were attractive. I could have taken those opportunities to cheat, but I didn't. I chose you, time and time again.*

*But when faced with the same opportunity, you didn't choose me.*

*As much as you claim to be sorry and to love me deeply, you can't change that. Love isn't just a feeling. It's something you choose.*

Input: What did you stop doing for others once you realized it was draining you?
Output: Showing up for people who wouldn’t show up for me.

Input: Fellow submissive women, how do you manage your sex life when being with another woman who is just as submissive?
Output: my partner and I go into the yard. we select two snails.

we put them on the drive way having selected our own. whose ever makes it to the end of the driveway must eat both snails. then we must select two older women. those women must then be willing to watch over us for 3 months. after 3 months and the appropriate ceremonies involving spinning a globe covered in candle wax, climbing a cactus using only our thighs, and harnessing 2 cats to a parcel delivery sled, we both vomit. Whose ever vomit looks most like the initial snail gets to choose the sex schedule for next year.

Input: What are the most desirable skills a partner could have?
Output: Common sense. From practical things I would say being able to do small fixes around house, car etc.

Input: What's something you don't like to do but do anyway to make your partner happy?
Output: Listen to his strategies about his fantasy baseball team

Input: Women who hated cooking but now enjoy it, what made you change?
Output: I left my husband. He used to make fun of my cooking and so I started to hate it. Now that I cook for myself, I enjoy it again.

Input: What’s one mindset shift that made your life feel lighter?
Output: I can’t control anyone but myself.

Input: Women who took a spontaneous trip alone — what made you decide, and what did you learn?
Output: I was bored, so I booked a trip on short notice and during the trip I discovered that I actually enjoy travelling solo more than travelling with others.

Input: ELI5 Why don’t houses in the Western US have basements?
Output: If you need your house foundation to be dug deep enough to go below the frost line, it's not a big cost to go all the way and add a basement. If you don't need to go below a frost line, like in southern california, adding a full basement will increase the cost of building the house

Input: ELI5 Why is it so hard to build any significant structure in space?
Output: Imagine you want to build a house that's about 250 miles away from where you are now. All your tools and building material are where you are currently standing so you're gonna have to ship them to the build site on a truck. Kinda expensive but still easily doable.

Oh except that your truck gets about 0.002 miles per gallon of gas.

Oh and also there are no gas stations between here and the build site so you have to carry a *ridiculously* large gas tank in order to make it the whole way.

Oh and since your gas tank is so big, there's only a small amount of cargo space to actually carry your materials in so you're gonna have to make multiple trips.

Oh and also your truck can only be used once. Each trip you have to make an almost totally new one from scratch, except maybe some of the tires and also the driver's seat.

Oh and also sometimes your truck explodes 🤷‍♀️

The process itself isn't that hard. We've known how to make trucks and build houses for ages. It's just all those other factors make it really super expensive.

Input: ELI5: Why must there be a Universal Common Ancestor?
Output: The main argument is that all living things share the same dna structures and it's very unlikely that it appeared exactly the same way several times.

Input: ELI5: Why is sweat salty? Why can’t we just sweat out pure water instead?
Output: If you sweated out pure water, then the blood and other bodily fluids left behind would be over-concentrated with salts. You would end up becoming sick from this (for specifically sodium chloride, you would develop a condition called hypernatremia)

Input: ELI5: Why does water at human temperature feel really good but air at human temperature feels stifling?
Output: Because water is a good at transmitting heat. Your body produces heat and needs to cool down (but not too much). Water that is slightly colder than you will still work fine in cooling you down, while air won't.


As soon as you get further away from body temperature, water will become unbearable, while air will still be relatively tolerable. Take a sauna of 90°C (190°F) or chilly weather of 5°C (40°F) outside. Those are uncomfortable but fairly tolerable for a while. However water of those temperatures is much more uncomfortable to downright harmful.


This property is also used in systems that use water cooling.

Input: ELI5: Why is NASA Mission Control in Houston Texas, 1000 miles away from where rockets launch?
Output: Florida was chosen for launches primarily because it was closer to the equator. This makes it more fuel efficient to launch rockets. It's also right next to the Atlantic which is convenient if a rocket fails and has to crash somewhere.

The French launch rockets from South America for the same reasons.

This is also why Baikonur Cosmodrome was built in Kazakstan, it's closer to the equator than say Moscow and it's pretty remote so plenty of room for a missile to crash (and harder for Western intelligence to spy on it).

Texas was chosen for mission control for NASA partly for political reasons (President Lyndon Johnson was from Texas), partly because it was close to a number of high end universities which is good for scientific research and staffing, and partly because of the good weather so there's less chances of communications disruption.

Input: ELI5: are air conditioners more efficient at night due to lower temperatures difference between inside and outside air?
Output: Yes, the heat exchanger will be able to dump more heat into the outside air more easily when it is cool outside versus when it is hot.

"More efficient" gets tricky because it depends on what you mean.  If it's 80 in the house, 60 outside, and you want the house to be at a temp of 70.  Then it is true that your AC is going to have to work less hard than if it was 90 outside, and thus be more efficient.

That said, it's less energy intensive to just open all the windows and bring that 60 degree air into the 80 degree house without involving the AC at all.

Input: ELI5: insects have minuscule brains, but still seem to know exactly what to do. How's that possible?
Output: The parts of your brain that makes you pull your hand back from a flame take up very little space in that really big brain of yours. Yet is is way bigger than that of an insect, because you are way bigger than an insect.

Most of our brain is used for processes that are not present in insects. Basic instinctual and autonomous behaviors take up really little space in comparison.

Input: ELI5 How F1 brakes, much more powerful, can reduce speed so much but my Pinto will lock the wheels with a weaker brake?
Output: The limiting factor is the grip between the tires and the road. F1 tires are sticky, huge, and hot, all giving them more grip. There's also downforce pushing the tires into the road to grip even better.

Input: ELI5: Why do dumbbells feel heavier than barbells/machine
Output: Stability, your body is working overtime to stabilize two weights instead of one

Input: ELI5 why luggage is lost and people lose so many luggage bags yearly
Output: I worked one of the top 5 busiest airports in the US for several years and watched luggage get “lost” many times. This particular airport had a long tunnel and the baggage carts would take the luggage from your drop-off point to the gate. Baggage cart trolleys were overstuffed and don’t have doors to keep everything in. They also have no suspension and drivers who are paid near minimum wage who are texting while driving beyond the tunnel speed limit. Bags would just fall off the carts due to bumps, swerving, overstuffing, and because it was behind them, they’d not see it or hear it (loud engines in enclosed tunnel with metal clanking everywhere). Another cart would come by and run it over or pick it up and throw it in their cart and send it to wherever. Occasionally they’d just get tossed to the side and left forever. There was piles of lost luggage covered in the basement soot that no one ever attempted to find.

Input: ELI5 Why does gastric juice not flow out of a person when they are upside down?
Output: Because you are not just a big open tube straight to your stomach. There are valves that open and close to keep everything in place.

Input: ELI5: why do older PC game discs have a hard time running on modern computers?
Output: The ELI5 answer is that those games were written for older operating systems and a lot of the supporting components and technologies have seen significant changes or been entirely removed.

Many older games were written for a 32-bit operating system, vs a modern 64 bit one for example.

Many games will work in compatibility mode though, although some will experience glitches and crashing.

Very old video games (like those from the 80s) might even have been written for a specific processor speed like 8mhz. They didn't use a timer to synchronize things like movement so on a modern CPU the game runs, but over 1000 the normal speed.

GOG as an example gets around these problems by packaging games with missing components, or running them on emulators like DosBox that simulates a DOS environment for software.

Some games though work just fine on modern OS's. Mechcommander for example works perfectly on a modern OS despite being from 1998. The developers did a pretty great job programming that game for future compatibility. Whether that was deliberate, or just by luck we don't know.

Input: ELI5: Why does gravity actually work? Why does having a lot of mass make something “pull” things toward it?
Output: Short answer: We don't know.


Longer answer: We've noticed that this happens in a consistent way. Einstein postulated that instead of viewing gravity as a force, we can model it as distortions in the "fabric of spacetime" as we came to call it, where heavy objects create "gravitational wells" and what we observe as gravity is actually normal movement through the distorted spacetime. It was also theorized that such distortions came in shape of gravitational waves, and we've confirmed that interpretation since (as the closest to an explanation that we have).


But the question of "why" probably cannot be answered. We don't know why anything (when talking about the fundamental laws).

Input: ELI5 how the three divers of Chernobyl didn't die from radiation exposure?
Output: Cuz they were diving, not exposed through air (or from inhaling radioactive dust/smoke)

Water is Very good at absorbing radiation. Think of this: if you spend all day in the pool your face and shoulders and arms will get sunburnt but your legs, just a few feet below water, are fine. Why? Because the UV Radiation from the sun is absorbed and blocked by the water.

So, while they came closer to the reactor, they were less exposed because the water protected their bodies.

Input: ELI5: What are DJs doing with all the knobs & buttons?
Output: For the sake of simplicity let's say that each side of the DJ device has a song playing. The right side has song A, the left has song B. The horizontal slider is usually the Crossfade, which means that if the slider is in the middle it is playing A and B equally. If the slider is all the way to the B side, the volume of A drops to 0. The up and down slides are similar, one might be for A the other for B. These control the volume (sometimes songs need to be balanced so they are at the same volume). The simplest set up will have 3 knobs for each side, high, Mid and Low. These control the amount of high sounds, mid sounds and low sounds. You want only bass? Turn low up and high and mid down. Another slider will control tempo (which also needs to be matched between A and B a lot of the time). This controls the speed at which each song plays (for simplicity let's say 2x as fast half as fast etc).

More complex set ups may have knobs which control effects (like an echo effect). They may also have buttons which allow looping, so 4 beats can be looped or 2 or even shorter/faster loops. 

Sometimes DJ's are just playing with the levels, cutting bass, bringing it back, timing the songs to Crossfade and transition to another track. Other times they may be doing something more complex like looping, using effects and creating tracks with samples or remixing them live.

Edit: the things that look like discs are to emulate vinyl turntables. So you can spin them forward, backward or "stop" them. This allows for "scratching", or other effects as well as precise placement of the track. You want side A to start at precisely 1 minute 45 seconds, so you spin that disc clockwise and it moves forward through the track.

A lot of "DJ's" do pre record. But for those that like this style of music it is a fun experience to go to a show and see someone create something new out of something old or to experiment and have fun in a way that is unique to that night/event.

Edit: Since this got a lot of traction I wanted to plug my soundc- just kidding.if you find a sound cloud using this name, do not listen to it, can't remember if one exists from me, but I'm sure it's shit if it's me. An idea I'm interested in but unsure if it's already done.. so I talked about the A and B side, these are "channels", it's possible to have many channels (my last mixer, which is the device in the middle with said knobs and sliders, had 4 channels). I've had a hard time time finding STEMS for a lot of songs I like. STEMS are separate tracks for each layer of the song, so if you played the STEM file for drums, you would only hear the drums for the track, rhythm would only hear rhythm etc. I wanted to live remix songs using STEMS. The only decent ones I found were through a remix competition I entered (got to the second stage but did not win). Anyway, I DO think some artists use their own STEMS for live mixing, this may have been the case with Alive 2007 by Daft Punk, not sure.

Input: ELI5: Why is it rare to see people addicted exclusively to psychedelics?
Output: Because psychedelics don't affect the brain the same way other drugs do. Other drugs tend to trigger extreme euphoria by activating the parts of the brain that tend to cause addictions. Psychedelics (at least the well known ones you're probably thinking of) mostly trigger different parts of the brain, and don't tend to directly produce large amounts of euphoria. Psychedelics also don't cause any physical dependency symptoms, so no need to keep doing the drug to fight off the withdrawal.

As an analogy: Psychedelics are enjoyable in a way that's more like going on an awesome mountain hike, where you have a unique and enjoyable experience, but you're exhausted afterwards and fine not doing them again for a while. "Other," drugs are more like eating super delicious ice cream where you will never feel full, and feel sick if you stop eating it, leading you to just want to keep taking them because more always feels better, and if you stop you feel like shit.

Input: ELI5 How do birds descend from dinosaurs despite being warm-blooded? Were those dinos never reptilian?
Output: It’s pretty clear from fossil evidence that dinosaurs were warm blooded. So, birds being warm blooded is not a surprise.

Essentially, dinosaurs were an advance form of reptile that included warm bloodedness.

Input: ELI5 why are induction cooktops/wireless chargers not dangerous?
Output: Iron in your blood is not (ferro)magnetic so does not interact with these fields in a meaningful way. Also these fields have extremely short range.

Input: ELI5 What is the Wow! signal and what is its significance?
Output: The universe is a fairly “noisy” place in terms of light and radiation. Scientists on earth use big telescopes like radar dishes to “listen” to this radiation noise to learn a lot of things about the nature of the universe, including to keep an eye out for anything that might signify the existence of other civilizations out there.

Most of what they hear is just natural background noise, like lying in a hammock in the woods and listening to the wind and a babbling stream. But one day the listeners heard something really loud for 72 seconds that was unlike anything else they had heard, perhaps like hearing a big boom or someone shout from across the forest. A scientist looking at the readings wrote WOW! next to the characters on the chart that read “6EQUJ5,” but these are just a representation of how intense the signal was: neither “WOW” nor “6EQUJ5” are any kind of message contained in the signal, contrary to popular misunderstandings.

What was the signal? Nobody knows for sure. It could be a broadcast from an alien race, but there’s really no evidence to support this idea specifically, over other things like a naturally occurring celestial phenomenon or just an errant reflection off of one of our own satellites orbiting the earth. Notably, nobody has replicated the signal, so whatever it was, it was apparently a one-off anomaly
